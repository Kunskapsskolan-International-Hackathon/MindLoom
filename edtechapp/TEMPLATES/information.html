        <h3>What is autism ?</h3><br>
        Autism, often referred to as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects
        individuals' social interaction, communication, behaviour, and sensory processing. This research report aims to provide
        an in-depth understanding of autism, its characteristics, causes, diagnosis, treatment, and the challenges faced by
        individuals with autism and their families. By delving into these aspects, we hope to contribute to the knowledge base
        surrounding autism, fostering better understanding and support for those affected by it. <br><br>
        
        Autism is a lifelong condition that typically becomes apparent in early childhood, and it varies in its severity and
        presentation. It is categorized as a spectrum disorder because it encompasses a wide range of symptoms, abilities, and
        levels of functioning. The exact cause of autism remains unclear, and it is a topic of ongoing research. While there is
        no known cure for autism, early intervention and support can significantly improve the lives of individuals with ASD.<br><br>
        
        Common symptoms of autism include:<br><br>
        • Difficulty with social communication and interaction<br>
        • Restricted interests and repetitive behaviours<br>
        • Sensitivity to sensory input<br>
        • Sensory processing difficulties<br>
        • Motor coordination and planning difficulties<br>
        • Emotional regulation difficulties<br><br>
        
        The exact cause of autism is unknown, but it is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental
        factors. Research suggests that autism may be caused by hundreds of different genes, each with a small effect.
        Environmental factors such as exposure to certain chemicals or viruses during pregnancy may also play a role.<br><br>
        
        Autism is typically diagnosed in early childhood, but it can be diagnosed at any age. Diagnosis is based on a
        comprehensive assessment of a child's development and behaviour. There is no one-size-fits-all test for autism, but a
        variety of tools and assessments can be used to help make a diagnosis.<br><br>
        
        There is no cure for autism, but there are a variety of treatments that can help people with autism manage their
        symptoms and improve their quality of life.<br><br>
        
        Treatment may include:<br><br>
        • Applied behaviour analysis (ABA)<br>
        • Speech therapy<br>
        • Occupational therapy<br>
        • Social skills training<br>
        • Medication<br>
        • Family support services<br>
        <br><br>        
        
        Side effects of Autism-<br><br>
        
        1. Sensory Sensitivities: Many individuals with autism experience heightened or diminished sensitivity to sensory
        stimuli, such as light, sound, touch, or taste.<br>
        
        2. Communication Difficulties: Autism often leads to challenges in verbal and non-verbal communication, such as limited
        speech, echolalia, or difficulty with conversation.<br>
        
        3. Repetitive Behaviors: Repetitive actions like hand-flapping, rocking, or spinning objects can be common.<br>
        
        4. Social Challenges: Difficulty in forming and maintaining social relationships, including difficulty with eye contact,
        empathy, or understanding social cues.<br>
        
        5. Emotional Regulation: Some individuals with autism struggle to manage their emotions, leading to emotional outbursts
        or meltdowns.<br><br>
