                <h2>Why use MindLoom?</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Games can help improve social communication skills: Research shows that games can help children with autism improve
                    their social communication skills, which can be challenging for them. Games can help children learn concepts such as
                    false belief, reciprocity, and strategy, and practice and develop a range of skills including communication,
                    perspective-taking, emotional regulation, emotional recognition, and sportsmanship.</li>  
                    <li>
                        Games can help children form independent relationships: Games are a cornerstone in child development, allowing children
                        to form independent relationships with one another. Autistic children often have difficulty forming peer relationships
                        and can be excluded from social settings. Games can provide a naturalistic and emergent setting for autistic children to
                        connect with their peers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Games can be motivating: Games may be motivating over and above other types of educational interventions. In-built
                        rewards systems that track advancement can help children stay engaged and motivated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mental support can help parents cope with stress: Parenting children with autism can be stressful, and parents may
                        experience stress associated with their childrenâ€™s challenging behaviors, communication difficulties, isolation, and
                        atypical attachment behavior. Mental support can help parents
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Websites can provide access to resources: Websites can provide access to resources that parents may not be aware of,
                        such as support programs and groups run by autistic adults and meet neurotypical and autistic parents with similar
                        experiences. Parents can discover new resources and find new friends for themselves and their children.
                    </li>
